## Running the Demos

The bundled files are already included for you; this allows you to run and modify the demos without needing to pull in any dependencies or build any bundles.

Serve up the main `kami` folder with `http-server` or a similar tool and open `localhost:8080` to browse the HTML demos.

```
cd kami/demos
http-server
```
